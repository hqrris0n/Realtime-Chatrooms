The purpose of a controller is to manage the specific calls for each "schema". For example,
the auth.controller.js file manages the different routes in addition to the "api/auth" route.
Within the controllers, we handle different calls to the database based on what that route should
do. So far, there are controllers for the auth and message schema that extend from the routes in 
the routes folder.
